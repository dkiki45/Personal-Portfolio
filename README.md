# My Academic Portfolio

Welcome to my academic portfolio! This project showcases my journey and learning experiences through various disciplines during my studies, primarily focusing on **web development, logic, algorithmic thinking, philosophy, and cyber-physical systems.**

This portfolio is a single-page application (SPA) style, where the main `index.html` acts as a central hub, linking to dedicated pages for each course and its respective projects and learned topics.

---

## Project Structure

The portfolio is organized into the following main sections, each representing a course with its specific content and projects:

* **Home (`index.html`):** The main landing page, providing an introduction to me and links to all course-specific pages.
* **Creative Experience (`experiencia-criativa.html`):** Projects demonstrating creativity, innovation, and agile methodologies.
* **Logic and Mathematics (`logica-matematica.html`):** Foundational concepts in propositional logic, truth tables, and syntactic manipulation.
* **Algorithmic Reasoning (`raciocinio-algoritmico.html`):** My learning path in Python programming, including data structures, control flows, and game development.
* **Philosophy (`filosofia.html`):** Reflections on fundamental questions, contemporary dilemmas, and critical thinking development.
* **Cyber-Physical Systems (`sistemas-ciberfisicos.html`):** Integration of hardware and software, focusing on Arduino projects and sensor interactions.
